                            Hey you guys! My name is Khandaker Sultana and I created Housewill. The reason
                            I created this site is that I saw there were no dedicated sites to helping people find their household item in minimum price.
                            . As a mother of 3 kids and I know how heard it is when there are a lot of gently used 
                            household items and specially infant baby product which anyone can easily use those who
                             are desperately in need of them.
                            I am hoping that through this site, the community can come together to help each other
                            and make our community a better place to live.
                        </h5>
